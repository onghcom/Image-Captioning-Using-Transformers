# Image-Captioning-Using-Transformers
Image Captioning deals with understanding of image and a language description for that image. The project required implementing an Image Captioning Model using Transformers defined in Attention is all you need paper. Flicker8k dataset is used for this project.

The task includes data preprocessing, defining model, positional encoding, multi-head attention, encoder-decoder layer, implement transfomer, model training and using BLEU evaluation metric.
